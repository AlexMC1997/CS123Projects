# CS123Projects
A collection of projects for 2D drawing and image manipulation and 3D rendering, all backed by OpenGL. Image creator includes several brushes and filters including a Fourier Transform implementation.
3D renderer includes a number of shading paradigms including physically based shading based on the Cook-Torrance BRDF. Mesh and scene loading is also supported.

Based on the excellent project stencil and course notes for Brown University's CS123. Stencil is at https://github.com/cs123tas/projects
